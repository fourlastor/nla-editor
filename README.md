# nla-editor

A non linear animation editor made in Compose

This is an app inspired by the Godot's animation editor, which lets you save keyframes of several entities and save them as a JSON file.

## How to use

The app has two modes:

1. Design: in this mode, you change the default properties of an entity
2. Animation: in this mode you set keyframes for an animation.

You can add child nodes to groups (you need to select them)

Scroll the timeline by dragging while holding the middle mouse button
Pan the preview by dragging while holding the right mouse button
